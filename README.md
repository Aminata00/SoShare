## 🍽️ So Share – Meal Sharing Made Simple

**So Share** is a modern web application inspired to me during my HackYourFuture course, built with **React** that makes it easy to share home-cooked meals with your local community. Whether you’re cooking extra portions or looking to try something new, So Share connects people through food, building connections one meal at a time.

### 🚀 Features

* 🏠 **Browse** shared meals in your area
* 🍳 **Post** your own meals for others to request
* 📅 **Reviews and Resevations** pick-up times and set availability

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS / Styled Components
* **Backend:** (SQL)
* **APIs:** MADE LOCALLY

### 📦 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/so-share.git
